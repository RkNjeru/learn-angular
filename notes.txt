TypeScript Introduction:
    - Classes:
        - constructor keyword
        - private keyword

    - Interfaces
        - like contract
        - defines property and methods a class has to implement if 
            it inherits the interface
        - '?' optional property, doesn't have to be implemented

    - Modules:
        - export keyword allows classes to be used in other files
        - modularity throughout the application in order export classes
            for other parts of the project
        - modularity approach
